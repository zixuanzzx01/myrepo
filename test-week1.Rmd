# Base Operations
Create objects and assign values.

```{r}
x <- 2
```

Remove objects.

```{r}
rm(x)
```


Boolean values: TRUE is given 1 and FALSE is given 0.
```{r}
# here are the code.
1 + TRUE 

# This will give you 2.
```

You can not add up strings. Instead, to concatenate strings, we should use `paste` or `paste0`.
```{r}
paste("xxx", "yyy", sep="")
x <- paste0("xxx", "yyy") # this produces the same value
```

Clear the environment. 
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

# Vectors
```{r}
numbers <- c(1,2,3,4)
class(numbers)
```

```{r}
typeof(numbers)
```
